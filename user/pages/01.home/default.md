It was like love at first site. Once getting Lucy's massage, that's it! No one else out there. I've been her client for more than 5 years. Lucy is a first class healthcare provider with deep knowledge of the human body and extensive experience to catch any problems just by touching her patients. She is also an excellent communicator, finding out the cause of problems and explain about her therapy and patients' needs through professional and personable conversations. In addition, Lucy never stops working to improve her skills and to bring the best to her clients. I would never dream of going to anyone else for the massage.
